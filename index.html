   <!--- Title
   ================================================== -->

   <!-- TODO: Change this to change the label displayed at the top of the website (look at the tab!) -->
   <title>

   </title>

   <!-- CSS
    ================================================== -->
   <!-- GOOD TO KNOW: This loads up what is known as a "stylesheet", essentially where all your CSS rules will go. The "href" attribute tells our file where to search for our stylesheets. Here it's saying "Start at where our file is located in our current folder and go into the css folder and find *.css. Then load it up."-->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/default.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/layout.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/media-queries.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/magnific-popup.css">

   <!-- Script
   ================================================== -->
   <!-- GOOD TO KNOW: This does the same thing as above except it instead loads a "script". A script, in this case, is what a file with jQuery code is called. On a side note, jQuery is a Javascript library (library = a set of pre-written code that some really really smart people wrote and allowed us all to use for free) that allows you to make edits to the html elements we have on this page. jQuery is often used to make websites interactive; this is what causes the website to scroll when you click on a link or change color when you're hovering over something. This won't be covered in the context of this workshop but if you want to make your website more interactive, learning jQuery can help you out! If you want to see a simple example of how jQuery works, open up js/init.js and check it out.-->
   <script src="js/modernizr.js"></script>

   <!-- Favicons
   ================================================== -->
   <!-- TODO: Look at the image that looks like a C at the top of your webpage near the title (look at the tab name). Currently, the picture that is being stored is the same as the picture stored in the same folder that this file is stored in under the name "favicon.png" (which is why the href attribute is equal to that). You can either choose to change that href attribute to point to your own custom picture (by dropping your picture into the folder this file is located in and changing the href attribute's value to point to that), or omit this following code entirely if you don't want to use an icon. 

   Note: if this is not displaying for you, try using a browser like Chrome! Browsers like Safari don't show this at the top-->
   <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.png" >

</head>

<body>

   <!-- Header
   ================================================== -->
   <header id="home">

      <nav id="nav-wrap">

         <a class="mobile-btn" href="#nav-wrap" title="Show navigation">Show navigation</a>
         <a class="mobile-btn" href="#" title="Hide navigation">Hide navigation</a>

         <!-- TODO: The following <li class="itemAtTop"> elements are what are displayed on the top of your page. If you want to change the text that is displayed on top, simply replace the text. If you want to change which element is highlighted at the beginning, make the initially highlighted <li> element the one that has class="itemAtTop current", since this tells the CSS stylesheets to apply different rules (i.e. coloring and stuff) to only the element with this class. If you want to change which div the elements lead to when they are clicked, change the href attribute to #{the id of the div you want it linked to} (i.e. #home). If you want to create more of these, simply copy and paste the li element.-->

         <!-- TODO: This TODO is a continuation of a TODO listed below in the resume section, on adding new sections to your resume. IGNORE THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT REACHED THAT POINT YET!

         Continuing from before, copy and paste any of the <li> elements in your desired position. For example, if you want to create your new button after General, copy and paste this belownGeneral:

         <li class="itemAtTop">
            <a class="smoothscroll" href="#home">
               General
            </a>
         </li>
   
         Note: make sure to make the class attribute class="itemAtTop" instead of
         class="itemAtTop current", unless you want this to be the initially selected element.

         Now change General to whatever text you want and make the href attribute #{the id you selected in the initial part}. Now refresh the page and it should work for you.

   ================================================== -->

   <!-- TODO:

        If you want to add another section, on top of Education, Work, and Skills, there is a multistep process involved in doing so.

        1) Copy everything from <div class="resume" id="education"> to </div>. When you are doing this, be very careful to stop at the correct </div>. The correct </div> will be the first </div> element that lines up vertically with <div class="resume" id="education">, so be very careful when you're doing this. Refresh your page once you have done this to make sure it works.

        2) Change <div class="resume" id="education"> to <div class="resume" id={INSERT AN ID HERE}>. Your id can be anything you want; however, the id that you pick at this point will be what you use above in order to make sure that the page scrolls to the right section when you implement smooth-scroll later on.

        3) Scroll up all the way to the top to where you defined General, About Me, Education, Work, and Skills. The instructions on how to add scrolling functionality to scroll down to this section from the top will be explained there in more detail. But make sure you keep track of the id that you used!

   <!-- GOOD TO KNOW: This does the same thing as above except it instead loads a "script". A script, in this case, is what a file with jQuery code is called. On a side note, jQuery is a Javascript library (library = a set of pre-written code that some really really smart people wrote and allowed us all to use for free) that allows you to make edits to the html elements we have on this page. jQuery is often used to make websites interactive; this is what causes the website to scroll when you click on a link or change color when you're hovering over something. This won't be covered in the context of this workshop but if you want to make your website more interactive, learning jQuery can help you out! If you want to see a simple example of how jQuery works, open up js/init.js and check it out.-->
